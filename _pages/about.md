## Research

I did my master's in physics from St. Joseph's University, Bangalore, India. I got an opportunity to work with Dr. Jayant Murthy from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics on a research project that was my master's thesis and which is now amalgamating into a paper. The project was to develop a model for the interstellar dust and gas in Messier 8. Dr. Murthy's earlier work on modelling the diffuse UV radiation within 10 degrees of the galactic plane found regions that were outliers to the model. This project is an attempt to explain some of those differences in Messier 8.
