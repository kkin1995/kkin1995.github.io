I recently completed my MSc in Physics, specializing in Astrophysics, and I am now applying for a PhD in Astrophysics. My lifelong passion for science, particularly physics, has steered me towards pursuing a career in this field.

Besides Astrophysics, I am deeply intrigued by Machine Learning. I believe that Machine Learning has immense potential to solve complex problems and analyze large datasets. I have been delving into this field through online courses and personal projects, and I plan to integrate Machine Learning into my Astrophysics research.

You can find my writings on various topics in Astrophysics, Machine Learning, and random musings on my [**Medium blog**](https://medium.com/@kkin1995). My goal is to share my knowledge and insights with others who share my interests.
