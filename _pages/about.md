I recently completed my MSc in Physics with a thesis in Astrophysics, and I am currently in the process of applying for a PhD in Astrophysics. From as long as I can remember, I have been interested in science, and in particular physics, which has led me to pursue a career in Astrophysics.

In addition to my interest in Astrophysics, I also have a keen interest in Machine Learning. I am fascinated by the potential of Machine Learning to help us solve complex problems and make sense of vast amounts of data. I've been exploring this field through online courses and personal projects, and I hope to incorporate Machine Learning into my research in Astrophysics.

I also write about various topics related to Astrophysics and Machine Learning on my blog, which you can find on [Medium](https://medium.com/@kkin1995). Through my blog, I aim to share my knowledge and insights with others who are interested in these fields.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I hope you enjoy exploring the rest of my website!
