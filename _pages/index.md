Hi there! My name is **Karan**. I recently completed a MSc in Physics focussing on Astrophysics and Machine Learning. I'm currently applying for a PhD in Astrophysics and collaborating on a research project with my thesis advisor which we plan to publish in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
